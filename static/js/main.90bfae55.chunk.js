This app was my first project that I spent considerable time on (100+ hours). I accomplished a replica of old school Super Mario Bros with the physics library libGDX and the map editor Tiled. My simplified version of Super Mario includes Goomba and Koopa as enemies. Mario's direction is driven by tilt controls and tapping for jumping. I used sprites to give Mario and his enemies the illusion of moving and created three distinct levels with Tiled. Interesting enough, a few months after I completed this app, an official mobile version of Super Mario Bros was released.
